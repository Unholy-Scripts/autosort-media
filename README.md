# autosort-media

[autosort-media](https://github.com/Unholy-Scripts/autosort-media)
This script was developed to automatically sorts files based on user-defined parameters.

The core script reads the user's input, and writes a sorting script that will sort and move files.

## Getting Started

The script [sortscriptbuilder.sh](https://github.com/Unholy-Scripts/autosort-media/blob/master/sortscriptbuilder.sh) should always be run as ''sudo''. It will force an exit if it is not. This is because there are commands which require root access within the script. 

## Contributions 

Contributions are currently appreciated, and welcomed but must be specifically directed at the creator [IONine](https://github.com/IOnine). Once I have established a reasonable system for contributing through the github interface, more instructions will be posted.

### Honorable Mentions

This was written as a compliment to the creator's installation of https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-irssi.

Please note that this project is in no way affiliated with autodl-irssi. All credit where credit is due to the 
autodl-community developers.
